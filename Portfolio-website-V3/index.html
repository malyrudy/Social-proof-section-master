        About Me

        Hello! My name is Lukas Rucky and I am in web development since 2022. It all started when I came into international company called ABB (don´t know if you know it but ABB specialises in robotics and also in automatization) and worked there as auditor. I´ve heared about web development on high school but I wasn´t interested these days. But after my manager told me "Hey, Lukas, you know that in our company you can learn new things for free? So only pick some field of study and you can start learning!"

        After that I´ve fell in love with front-end development. You can see my portfolio which I´ve created down bellow. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

        Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

        JavaScript (ES6+)
        Jquery
        TypeScript
        HTML
        CSS
        SASS
